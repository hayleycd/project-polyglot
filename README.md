### Project Polyglot

Although I have been a developer for several years,
I still primarily do most of my work in Python. 

My goal is to become a developer advocate. To help prepare me
for this, I am wanting to get exposed to more languages, so I 
can talk to more developers. 

I am working through problems at projecteuler.net in groups 
of five. I am going to solve the problems, then refactor them
and test them. 

Each group of five I will do first in Python, before moving on to languages
that I am less familiar with. 

I will be blogging about the process over on my blog.
